# Project 1: Phase 2

## How to Play

Your main goal is to kill all coins and earn the most points.  After each wave, the difficulty ramps up more and more and enemies get tougher and tougher.  Every 5 waves, you can improve your character by shooting the specific upgrade you want.         

You can move your character using WASD.  You can shoot using the left mouse click and reload using right mouse click.

2. An additional reward mechanic I added to the game is the upgrade system.  Every 5 waves, 3 upgrades show up and in order to select one, you can shoot the wanted upgrade box.  Various upgrades include a speed upgrade, an increase in ammo, lower reload time, bullet speed, etc.    

3. An additional obstacle added to the game is the new enemy system.  Instead of the coins being collectibles that increase your score, coins are now enemies that can dash at the player and can cause damage.  

4. As you get into later waves, the amount of enemies get larger and the enemies' health and damage increase.
